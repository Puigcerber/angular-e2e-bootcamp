# AngularJS e2e Bootcamp

Simple app for my presentation of e2e-testing with Protractor as a mentor of the [Philos.io](https://www.philos.io/)
JavaScript & AngularJS Bootcamp in Brussels.

## Installation

We need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) previously installed.

To manage client side dependencies we install [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

And after cloning the repository we install the project dependencies.

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Usage

Start the server.

```
$ npm start
```

And run the tests.

```
$ npm test
```
